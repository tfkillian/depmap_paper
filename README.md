# Abstract

The `depmap` package facilitates access in the R environment to the data from
the Depmap project, a multi-year collaborative effort by the Broad Institute and
Wellcome Sanger Institute, mapping genetic and chemical dependencies and other
molecular biological measurements of over 1700 cancer cell lines. The `depmap`
package formats this data for use of popular R data analysis and visualizing
tools such as `dplyr` and `ggplot2` to represent and visualize these rich
datasets. In addition, the `depmap` package utilizes `ExperimentHub`, storing
versions of the Depmap data accessible from the Cloud, which may be selectively
downloaded, providing a reproducible research framework to support exploiting
this data. This paper describes a workflow demonstrating how to access and
visualize the Depmap data in R using this package.
